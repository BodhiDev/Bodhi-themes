BlingBling Enlightenment theme is the old default theme for Enlightenment:

   It is intended to be conservative and still show 
   off some aspects of Enlightenment such as 
   the ability to animate transitions and do 
   different layouts for objects. 

  The original theme was created by Rasterman. Further work on it was done by 
  'verdegal37' 

  With considerable help from Duma I have started porting the theme 

  The Elementary code is from a derivation of this theme, "R-Volcano R-E19" by 'rpil' 
  from [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/R-Volcano+R-E19?content=167690).
  It has been modified only to the point that the most e20 dialogs look good enough,
  expect some inconsistencies in e apps.

  Full credit goes to the artists, in particular 'rpil' and 'Duma'. 
  My role is limited to technical adaptation and minor fixes.

  Please note that this is work in progress and not yet complete.
